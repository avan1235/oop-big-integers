# Big Numbers representation

Your task is to:
 1. finish the implementation of [`BigInt`](./src/main/java/pl/edu/mimuw/BigInt.java) class. Provide methods for addition, multiplication and string representation of numbers as well as parsing big numbers from string (you can assume that the input `String` number is valid number representation that may start with `-` and then contains only digits).
 2. provide some more tests to prove that your implementation works - you have to write 2 of them by yourself. The tests can be found in [`BigIntTest`](./src/test/java/pl/edu/mimuw/BigIntTest.java) and you can run them locally by running
    ```shell
    ./gradlew test
    ```
    from the repository directory in your shell.
 3. Open pull request to [my repository](https://github.com/avan1235/oop-big-integers) and wait for review (it'll be public).
